document, see :doc:`intro/index`.

For a description of the process of tiling (the abstraction of genomic sequences
that makes Lightning possible) and the functions and pipelines we provide for tiling
genomes, see :doc:`tiling/index`.

For a description of our representation of tiled genomes (Compact Genome Format),
see :doc:`cgf/index`.

For a description of our in-memory database for tiled genomes (Lantern), including
the REST API it supports, see :doc:`lantern/index`.

For a description of our in-memory database for tile variants (the tile library),
see :doc:`tile_library/index`.

For a description of Annotile, the way we support annotations of tile variants, how
to import annotation software, and how to add human-generated annotations, see
:doc:`annotile/index`.

For a description of Lightning Data Structures, used for interaction with the
Lightning APIs, see :doc:`data_structures/index`.

For a description of Lightning APIs, see :doc:`api/index`.
