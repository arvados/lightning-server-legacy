Tiling Overview
================

Lightning is made possible by the process of ``tiling``, which takes advantage of
the high degree of redundancy in a population of genomes. Tiling partitions genomes
into ``tiles``: overlapping, variable-length sequences that begin and end with unique
k-mers, termed ``tags``. This document is an overview of our tiling implementation,
along with the crunch scripts and pipeline templates available for tiling genome
inputs.

We currently accept GFF files and Complete Genomics CGI-var files as inputs.

.. todo::
    * Document PASTA/FASTA
    * Write basic instructions for writing one's own conversion of file to a tiling
      (As I understand it, one must write a conversion between that file format
      and PASTA, then probably add a pipeline template component).
