Batch Processing
=================

The API calls are excellent for one-off queries. However, many users may wish to
use these calls many times for many samples and/or over large parts of the genome.
To speed up these queries and reduce load on the server, Lightning plans to
support batch processing.

Filter to Find Tile Variants Matching Filters
----------------------------------------------
    Finds tile variants fulfilling a specified filters

    * REGEX on sequence, start tag, or end tag
    * Float comparison on length, the number of positions spanned, the frequency
      of this tile, or the number of callsets called at this position
    * True/False on whether the tile is at the start of path or at the end of the
      path

Retrieve the Library Around a Group of Loci
--------------------------------------------
    Returns a list of tile-positions touching given loci, a dictionary of
    tile-variants touching those loci with the sequence of the tile variant, cut
    off if appropriate, and the tag-length. We should be able to name the loci
    for convenience.
