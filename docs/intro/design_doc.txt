Lightning Design Doc
=====================

**Goal**: Specify Lightning v0.1.0 in enough detail that it can be implemented and tested.


Lightning v0.1.0 Features
---------------------------

Features here are expected to only work for well-sequenced tile variants. Poorly
sequenced tile variants/partial tile variants should return a null value.

* Stores 1 byte of quality information for all bases (well sequenced versus poorly
  sequenced)
* Stores human genomes assuming phasing from called genome input
* Retrieves well-sequenced subsequences from population (subsequences identified by tile position)

  * Subsequences may be in the form of bases
  * Subsequences may be in the form of tiles

* Allows filtering

  * by population subsets (named by id)
  * by regions of interest (named by tile)
  * by tile variant (named by md5sum, only well-sequenced tiles)
  * by combinations of the above

* Provides translation between tile positions and reference locations (GRCh37,
  GRCh38)
* Tiles genomes provided in GFF and gVCF formats
* Can convert tiled genomes to GFF and/or gVCF
* One pipeline is required to add a new genome
* Stores annotations from ClinVar and annotation pipelines, such as CAVA
* Retrieves annotations for one or multiple tile variants (identified by tile
  variant identifier)
* Retrieves tile variants with one or multiple annotations (identified by
  annotation identifier)

Lightning v0.1.0 Benchmarking Goals
------------------------------------

* Uses up to 70 MB per human genome
* Retrieves the sequences of 50 contiguous tiles from 100 human genomes in 5 seconds
* Retrieves the 50 contiguous tiles from 100 human genomes in less than a second
* Filtering on above query with any option does not change the observable time
* Tiling genomes from GFF/gVCF takes 1 hour per genome
* Annotates the tile library for 100 human genomes in 2 hours
* Filtering on annotations or tile variants for tile library of 100 genomes takes
  less than 1 second

Lightning v0.1.0 Usage
-----------------------

Lightning v0.1.0 should be run by Curoverse and should include 178 whole genomes
from the Personal Genome Project and 502 whole genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project.
The tile library should be annotated with CAVA, ClinVar, and ExAC data. The public
should be able to retrieve well-sequenced subsequences from this population, filter
on them by population subsets, by regions of interest, by tile variant, and/or by
annotations.

Users should be able to upload whole genomes, with the understanding that this
Lightning instance is public. These newly added genomes should be added to the
tile library, new sequences should be annotated with CAVA, ClinVar, and ExAC
annotations, and these genomes should be added to those we can filter on.

Lightning v0.1.0 API
---------------------
See :doc:`Lightning v0.1.0 API Specifications <../api/index>` for API details.

Future Versions Lightning Features
-----------------------------------

* Support partial tile variants for features detailed in v0.1.0
* Stores unphased and phased human genomes, including phase groups for features
  detailed in v0.1.0
* Provides translation between tiles and alternate reference locations
* Compare multiple genomes with each other



Future Versions Lightning Usage
--------------------------------

Users should set up an Arvados cluster. From there, they should be able to run
Sprite, which will allow them to import their data without making it public. From
there, users should be able to use Sprite identically to the v0.1.0 Lightning
instance.
