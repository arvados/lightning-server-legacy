Importing a Genome
===================

Importing a genome is difficult. We'll probably do it using pipelines. Have one
pipeline in pipeline_templates that is run when someone uploads a genome.

We acknowledge that phenotypes or meta-information about each genome is
vital for interpreting results. However, the breadth of available phenotype
databases and the number of possible pieces of information makes using Lightning
as a phenotype database infeasible. Sprite provides a preliminary phenotype database,
which includes information about whether each genome (or set of calls, also known
as a callset) is a reference. Additionally, it stores whether the phases are well
known, as well as the sex and the ethnicity.
