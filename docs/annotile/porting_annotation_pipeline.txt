Adding an Annotation Pipeline to Annotile
==========================================

Build a component for the `annotate_tile_variants` pipeline. This is likely to
require implementing a crunch script and creating a docker image.

Automated Annotation Pipelines
-------------------------------

If the annotation pipeline you wish to port cannot use a VCF file (aligned against
GRCh37) as input, you will also need to implement a component to generate the
required input for your annotation pipeline. Use the `create-vcf-per-tile` component
as an example.

The components you implement must output a collection with a directory named
`annotile_input`.

    After implementing annotile, document the output format requirements

User-added Annotations
-----------------------

User added annotations can be converted into a component in the `annotate_tile_variants`
pipeline by hard-coding annotations applying to specific tile variants. A component
which does this already is linked to a Sprite user-added annotations app. Use this
component and application as an example.
